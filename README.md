# CarEship (Ship with care) üöóüçÉ


## Project background (Problem description)

In 2021, World Health Organization [stated](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-traffic-injuries) that about 1.3 million people had died in road crashes in the world. Moreover, [14.9 million people's death](https://www.who.int/news/item/05-05-2022-14.9-million-excess-deaths-were-associated-with-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-2020-and-2021) was linked to an infectious disease called Covid-19, from the beginning of 2020 until the end of 2021. Nowadays, it is crucial to minimize such risks from fatal outcomes on the roads and from an infectious disease, in order to potentially save many lives, and possibly, raise the quality of life.

Delivery services are a preferred way of ordering certain items online, if you are unable to go straight to the facility or just want to stay at home. However, the items that are delivered straight to door are most commonly delivered by human beings, who while delivering have a risk of dying in a road accident or can transmit an airbourne disease, that upon delivery can infect the customer. Therefore, it is neccesary to come up with a solution, that would minimize the risk of transmitting a disease, or dying due to a road accident while desired items are being delivered. 



## What are you going to make?

We want to develop a remotely controlled smart car that is able to deliver wanted items from the pharmacy to the customers in need of medication. The smart car will be controlled by an application used by the pharmacist and the customer can follow the delivering process through a tracking number.



## Why are you going to make it? 

We want to make a product that will revolutionize the way goods are delivered. Which implies that the goods will be delivered using a remote control with an authorized person controlling the vehicle remotely. Moreover, we want to avoid human contact if the customer has an infectious disease, therefore it would be more convenient. Additionally, the smart car will be able to drive autonomously. 

* The first problem it will solve is it will reduce car crashes due to tiredness in the way that the vehicle is gonna have an obstacle avoidance feature and it is gonna be remotely controlled. 
* The second problem it will solve is it will potentially save lives by reducing the transmission of airborne diseases, by having a remote car control feature. 
* The third problem it will solve is that it will eliminate CO2 emissions from car exhaust, since it is going to be powered by electrical batteries. 




## How are you going to make it? 

We plan to develop an application using Android studio as a GUI. The application will have customer-side and staff-side.

* The customer-side will include login functionality, register account, list of medicines available, orders history, ability to order medicine.

* The staff-side of the app is also going to have login functionality and additionally it is going to display orders from customers and staff member will be able to control the car through the joystick in order to deliver the order. The staff member will be able to choose an autonomous driving mode, where the car will drive by itself and avoid obstacles.  
 
* all the data about both customer and staff users would be stored in a firebase database.


## Expected impact üåè

- Road accident reduction
- Financial expenditure reduction
- Minimizing risk of transmitting airborne diseases through a courier-delivery.  




## Tools and Technologies üñ•Ô∏è

- Java
- C++
- Android Studio
- Arduino IDE
- SmartCar Platform
- FireBase
- Espresso UI testing
- Godot

## User testing

#### 4 students from the SEM program have tested our app based on these questions:

1. As a customer, you don‚Äôt have an account in the carEship application. Can you create an account in the app?
2. After logging in as a customer, you would like to see the list of products based on the symptoms you have. Can you find a way to do that?
3. As a customer, you don‚Äôt have time and you can‚Äôt scroll and see every product in the list of medicines. Can you search for it and find it as soon as possible?
4. As a customer, you want to buy something from the list and pay for it. Can you find a way to pay for your order?
5. As a customer, you want to enter your delivery information after the payment, so the products can be delivered to your address. Can you find a way to do that?
6. As a customer, you want to be able to see the list of orders you have made. Can you find your order history?
7. As a staff member, you want to activate autopilot mode on the smartcar. Can you do it?
8. As a staff member, you want to call the customer. Can you do it?

#### After the testing was completed, the students were presented with the SUS(System Usability Scale) [quiestionnaire](https://forms.gle/ex9RzhDhXhsiJSG78):

   (Note: the grading is on 1 to 5 scale, with 1 being "Strongly Disagree", and 5 being "Strongly Agree".) 

1. I think I would like to use this system frequently. Average score(the higher the better): 4.5
2. I found the system unnecessarily complex. Average score(the lower the better): 1.25
3. I thought the system was easy to use. Average score(the higher the better): 4.0
4. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system. Average score(the lower the better): 1.5
5. I found that the various functions in this system were well integrated. Average score(the higher the better): 4.5
6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system. Average score(the lower the better): 1.0
7. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly. Average score(the higher the better): 4.0
8. I found the system very cumbersome to use. Average score(the lower the better): 1.25
9. I felt very confident using the system. Average score(the higher the better): 4.25
10. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with the system. Average score(the lower the better): 1.25 

An additional question that is not included in SUS:

11. I found the app intuitive to use. Average score(the higher the better): 4.25

#### Measurement scale

To better understand where the final SUS score would stand, the [grading scale](https://measuringu.com/interpret-sus-score/) from F to A+ was used in the measuring.

#### Results:

The total SUS score based on 4 users tested is 87.5, which falls into A+ grade(84.1-100 SUS points) of the measurement scale.
